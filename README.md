# Mysterious Organism - Code Academy

This is a project for the Code Academy - for studying mostly factory functions.
This was quite challenging, and I definitely need more practice with this. Nonetheless, this was good!

I appreciate any feedback!

Definitely need to study more about factories, constructors, and classes.

## Exercise Context

Youâ€™re part of a research team that has found a new mysterious organism at the bottom of the ocean near hydrothermal vents. Your team names the organism, Pila aequor (P. aequor), and finds that it is only comprised of 15 DNA bases. The small DNA samples and frequency at which it mutates due to the hydrothermal vents make P. aequor an interesting specimen to study. However, P. aequor cannot survive above sea level and locating P. aequor in the deep sea is difficult and expensive. Your job is to create objects that simulate the DNA of P. aequor for your research team to study.
